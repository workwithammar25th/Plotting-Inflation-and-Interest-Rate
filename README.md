# Plotting-Inflation-and-Interest-Rate
This is a beginner-friendly data science project that visualizes the relationship between inflation rates and interest rates from 2015 to 2024 using a small CSV dataset and Python.  The goal is to create a basic line chart showing how these two key economic indicators move over time — helping understand if there’s a visible pattern or trend.


How to Run:

pip install pandas matplotlib
python plot_economy.py
